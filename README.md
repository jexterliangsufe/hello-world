# hello-world
Finally I come here and hope to be better!

It is not my first time to use Github but the first time to write on Github.

I have a Bachlor degree on statistics now and I am going to have a Master degree of Big data tech and economic statistics on 2022.

And for now, I am focusing on looking for a summer intern in big IT companies.

Best wishes for everyone!
